# AIA

## Unit description

The Gomoku project focus on decision making in a two players game.
Theory of Min-Max and Monte-Carlo algorithms will be presented as examples.
Also we will talk about Machine Learning through Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network.

# Projects

* [Gomoku](https://github.com/sheiiva/gomoku)


## SUBJECTS COVERED:
* Formalize the problem
* Define efficient structures
* Implement a decisional algorithm
* Create a complete Gomoku AI able to deploy and adapt strategies
* Comply with an existing protocol


## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED:

* **Knowledge representation**
how to define complete and efficient goal-driven data structure.

* **Min-max, Monte-Carlo or equivalent**
understand their usage in a two-player strategy decision process, and to be able to choose one of them.

* **Heuristic**
think and implement a non-static heuristic that efficiently estimate solutions.

* **Efficiency and testing**
aiming at the best possible efficiency by testing live one's program
