# DevOps

## Unit description

In this module, you will learn the **basics of DevOps**, a modern popular software engineering movement.
You will explore several extremely used tools in the ecosystem, primarily based on (but not limited to) the notion of "**containers**" and "**automation**", which you will get to discover.

All the notions and technologies you will see in this module will be useful for your other projects, and will help you be more efficient and successful with them.
