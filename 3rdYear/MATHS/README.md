# MATHS

## Unit description

* Operations Research Unit
* Advanced scientific calculation algorithms

Operations research is the integrality of methods and models that allow **numerous business management** and **organization problems** to be clarified and resolved. The goal of this unit is to introduce a few of the important **classic algorithms in scientific calculation** that are used in operations research.

## SUBJECTS COVERED:
The concept of the **complexity of algorithms**, **graph theory**, **linear systems** and programs and **interpolation**.


## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED *in order to validate the unit*:
You must demonstrate that you are familiar with, and know how to, apply complex mathematical algorithms. 
You will be evaluated on the completion of nine mini-projects.

There are 3 themed skills in this unit, each granted by 1 credit.
* **1° Algorithmic**: *projects 301 305 307*
* **2° Data structures** (matrices/graphs): *projects 302 303 304 306*
* **3° Interpolation**: *projects 308 309*


## Skills to be acquired
The following interdisciplinary skills will also be taken into account during the validation of the unit:
* precision
* seriousness
* punctuality
* professional behavior
