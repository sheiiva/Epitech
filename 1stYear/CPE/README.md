# Concurrent Programming 

## Unit description

In a variety of ways, this unit will train you in (and allow you to practice the basics of) programming and **problem analysis** and the division and rigorous implementation that they demand.

This unit covers classic programming aspects such as **simple data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks)** in different scenarios (data sorting, identifying holes in grid maps).


# Projects
* [BSQ](https://github.com/sheiiva/bsq)


### Skills to be acquired
* Be capable of showing accuracy: reading a subject correctly, coding within the Norms in order to have a clear and logical division of projects, following the renderingâ€™s instructions...
* Demonstrate the ability to correctly employ the language: syntax and simple data structures 
* Demonstrate the ability to solve simple problems by using simple algorithms 
* Make at least one functional rendering
