# UNIX PROGRAMMING

## Unit description

This unit is the next installment of the nm/objdump and ASM x86-64 projects. It's going to enable you to have a better understanding of ELF files and reverse engineering. It will allow you to understand how debuggers and disassemblers function in UNIX.   

Next installment of the first year's UNIX system programming unit. All projects are to be exclusively done in C/UNIXX (given that it's the next installment of the 1st year's PSU), except when explicitly stated otherwise in the subject:  


# Projects
* [Malloc](https://github.com/sheiiva/Epitech/tree/master/2ndYear/PSU/PSU_2019_malloc)
* [nm/objdump](https://github.com/sheiiva/Epitech/tree/master/2ndYear/PSU/PSU_2019_nmobjdump)


## SKILL TO BE COVERED:
* discern the userland's kernel space;  
* which information can be retrieved in a process; 
* explore the system call concept in greater depth; 
* learn how to plot a program's execution; 
* become an expert in Unix system programming; 
* learn how to decode x86-64 binary instructions. 
* Memory allocation management (brk(2), sbrk(2), malloc project)
* Understanding of the mechanisms of memory management *(in particular the links between physical memory and virtual memory)*
* Understanding of the structure of a binary(ELF) file format 

#### Skills to be acquired

* Master the basics of debugging in Linux (ptrace(), ...).
* Know the structure of assembler instructions once they've been compiled. 
* Know how the system handle a process's code in terms if resources and dependencies. 
* Technical skills
* Organizational and personal (precision etc.) skills 
* "Group work management"
