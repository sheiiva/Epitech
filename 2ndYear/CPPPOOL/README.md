## SUBJECTS COVERED:
You will discover object-oriented programming through the fundamental elements of the C++ language. Classes, instances and methods will (almost) no longer be a secret! 

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED *in order to validate the unit*:

* Correct usage of the C++ language and its special features in relation to C.
* The ability  to produce a basic C++ program in Unix.
* The ability to wake up early, be punctual and work regularly
* The ability to be precise in the reading, and comprehension, of one's code.

You must be familiar with the fundamentals of probability and master several classic statistics methods. 
You will be evaluated through the completion of 10 mini-projects.

* Concentration
* Punctuality
* Courage
* Strength
* Honor
* Respect
* Perseverance
* Drive
