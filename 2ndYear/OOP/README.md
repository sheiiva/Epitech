## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED *in order to validate the unit*: 

#### PARADIGM SHIFT
turning-in projects without non-justified C code (excluding libc, C-style casts)

#### MODULARIZATION
use of class to separate the projects into several parts that are LOGICAL and COHERENT.

#### ABSTRACTION AND GENERIC PROGRAMMING
use of polymorphism through inheritance in order to factorize common code and for more genericity.
