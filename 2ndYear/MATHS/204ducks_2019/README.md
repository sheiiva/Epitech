The project
----
When ducks are disturbed by a sudden noise, they fly away almost simultaneously, leaving the pond empty.

To note: ***a* is a real constant between 0 and 2.5**, which depends on external factors (such as temperature, day time, duck’s health etc...). 

A study is being conducted about these ducks, and you are asked to compute and display the following, given the value of *a*:
* The average time after which ducks come back
* The standard deviation of the ducks’ return time
* The time after which 50% of all of the ducks are back
* The time after which 99% of all of the ducks are back
* The percentage of ducks that come back after 1 minute
* The percentage of ducks that come back after 2 minutes

## USAGE:

```
>> ./204ducks a
```

#### DESCRIPTION
* a       constant
