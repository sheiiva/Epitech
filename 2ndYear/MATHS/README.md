# MATHS

## Unit description
#### Probablilty and Statistics Unit.

You must be able to **create algorithms** by using mathematical methods, and be at ease with **graphic tools** (plotting different kinds of curves).

## SUBJECTS COVERED:
The unit consists of two sections: 5 probability classes and 5 statistics classes. 
* 1째 **Probability**: random experience, events, probabilities, random variables and a few famous discrete or continuous variable laws. 
* 2째 **Statistics**: descriptive statistics, statistic adjustments, correlation, survey sampling.

## SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED *in order to validate the unit*: 
There are two types of skills required to validate the unit:

* 1째 mastery of more complex scientific computing algorithms *(formula decoding, combinatorial computing analysis, without intermediate storage in memory...)*
* 2째 ability to manage complicated numerical calculations, which requires a good, preexisting comprehension and intelligent implementation *(descriptive statistics parameters, correlation parameters, expected value and variance with numerical integration...).* 

You must be familiar with the fundamentals of probability and master several classic statistics methods. 
You will be evaluated through the completion of 10 mini-projects.

#### Skills to be acquired
Interdisciplinary skills are taken into account for validating the unit: precision, seriousness, punctuality, professional behavior.
