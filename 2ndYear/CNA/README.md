# COMPUTER NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

## Unit description
#### Probablilty and Statistics Unit.

You must be able to **create algorithms** by using mathematical methods, and be at ease with **graphic tools** (plotting different kinds of curves).    


# Projects
* [Groundhog](https://github.com/sheiiva/CNA_groundhog)
* [Trade](https://github.com/sheiiva/CNA_trade)


## THE PROJECT:
The goal of this project is to **play around with stock market prices**.
In other words, buying and selling stock according stock market's prices.
Of course, just like in real life, you won't know which price the stock will have; it's an "interactive" system. 

## GENERAL MAP :
In order to support you in achieving your own algorithm, this unit is made up of the following elements:
* a first project to introduce THE most used tools in the stock market field for decision taking (sell/buy/wait).
* a second project "Trade", that takes you to the elaboration of your own algorithm.


## Skills to be acquired
* Research professional tools and how to implement them.
* Develop a custom algorithm
* Interface with an existing plateform
* Algorithm optimisation and live tweeking
